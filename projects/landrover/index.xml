      <description>&lt;p&gt;My Landrover Defender 110 lost one of its rear mudflaps a while back and was looking rather tatty as a result. So after a few months of putting the job off, I finally bought some replacement rubber and set about putting things right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old flap had torn off, leaving a stub still attached to the bracket by a couple of rivets: &lt;a href=&#34;/images/landrover/mudflap/DSCF1944.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/landrover/mudflap/DSCF1944_thumb.png&#34; alt=&#34;Torn off mudflap&#34; title=&#34;Torn off mudflap&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt; The old rubber must have come loose previously as one of the rivets was replaced witha  nut and bolt. I removed that and drilled out the two remaining rivets to be left with an empty bracket: &lt;a href=&#34;/images/landrover/mudflap/DSCF1951.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/landrover/mudflap/DSCF1951_thumb.png&#34; alt=&#34;Bracket with old rivets removed&#34; title=&#34;Bracket with old rivets removed&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was simply a case of attaching the replacement rubber to the bracket using new M6 bolts and locking nuts and a couple of large repair washers to hold everything in place, as shown here: &lt;a href=&#34;/images/landrover/mudflap/DSCF1952.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/landrover/mudflap/DSCF1952_thumb.png&#34; alt=&#34;Bolt and washer arrangement&#34; title=&#34;Bolt and washer arrangement&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job took a total of about 30 minutes and most of that was because my cordless drill ran out of juice as it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really powerful enough to dril lout the rivets, meaning I had to dig out my big corded drill. I&amp;rsquo;m pleased with the result as balance has been restored to the rear of my truck: &lt;a href=&#34;/images/landrover/mudflap/DSCF1958.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/landrover/mudflap/DSCF1958_thumb.png&#34; alt=&#34;Balance restored!&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
