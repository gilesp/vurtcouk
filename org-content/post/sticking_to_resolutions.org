Approaching the end of January, I'm willing to bet that most New
Year's resolutions have already fallen by the way side. There are
countless gym memberships going unused and many journals started only
to peter out around now. I'd also guess that most people won't think
too much about it until the end of the year when they'll resolve to
really try this time around...

The thing is, you don't need to wait until the end of the year to
start a new habit or set yourself a new objective. Every day is the
start of a new year if you want it to be. Why pile on the pressure by
making a New Year's resolution in haste on the 1st of January? Think
through what you want to achieve and start today.

I decided on the 24th of December to start doing press ups in the
morning before my shower. Since the birth of my son last year, I'd got
out of the habit of exercising regularly so I'm not very strong at
all. I could have waited until the new year, but by then my resolve
would have probably faded. Couple that with potential embarrassment
when people asked how many press ups I could do or how it was going
and I'd probably never have even started.

Instead, I have taken a "soft launch" approach to my resolution. The
first day I just did as many press up as I could. Which turned out to
be 5. Yup, I'm a tall skinny weakling. The next day I managed 5 again.
The day after, 6. The day after that, 7, barely. 

I've been doing it every day since then, aiming to do at least one
more each day, but I'm satisfied if I match the previous day. By doing
it every day, I've built up quite a streak and I don't want to break
that now. That motivation increases each day, until (hopefully) this
becomes a habit and I don't even have to think about it.

I can currently do 16 press ups. It's not much but it's a 300%
improvement on where I started ;-)
