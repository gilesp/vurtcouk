For the past couple of years I've been trying various organisation and
productivity tools/schemes in order to be more organised in my daily
life.

I've tried:

- GTD
- Google Keep
- Ad-hoc todo lists
- org-mode agenda
- Trello
- many others

While the tools and techniques were interesting, none of them really
stuck with me. Part of this is because it's hard to form a new habit
but also it's hard to know which parts of a technique you should use
and which aren't relevant to you.

Often I would get bogged down in implementation details and tool
tinkering, rather than actually using the technique.

Recently I looked at striketh.ru and bullet journalling, and this
reignited my love of analogue - pens, paper, propelling pencils, oh
my!

I decided that I'd combine aspects of each technique that I'd looked at
into something I could probably stick to. By picking just the parts
that seemed to fit my needs and existing behaviours, I hoped that I'd
come up with something that would work for me and hence be something I
could stick with. 

In the best pretotyping traditions, I started with a bundle of Index
cards, carried with me. The main sections are a daily todo list,
individual project tasks lists, and an ad-hoc note area.

One key thing I wanted was to do it every day for 3 months and then review it
after that to figure out what works and what doesn't (No daily
tinkering - stick to it and form the habit first). This way I could
hopefully make using the system second nature before I start trying to
improve it.

So that's what I've done. I use it every week day and some weekends.
It's going well so far - I will write in more detail later how it all
works and will write up my 3 month review.
