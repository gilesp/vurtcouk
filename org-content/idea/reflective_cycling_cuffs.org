I am a utility cyclist (I ride an upright dutch bike with a box on the front as part 
of my daily commute). For this I wear normal clothes as much as possible, but I also
look for ways to improve my visibility at night with retro-reflective (not Hi-Viz) fabrics.

I'd like to make my hands/gloves more visible when indicating turns, so a slip on patch or
band made of elasticated reflective material would be useful.

Alternatively a velcro backed reflective patch could be used for wooley gloves.

Key features:

 * Silver/grey retro-reflective fabric
   * Could be different colours for visibility during the day as well?
 * Elasticated, for ease of slipping on or off.
