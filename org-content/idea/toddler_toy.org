A robust box with a large RGB led (could be a separate dome that lights up, or make 
the toy a cube that lights up entirely?)

There would be 3 knobs to allow for mixing the colours - the child could then adjust 
the colour at will

Chunky button(s) to change light up mode:
 * flash
 * pulse
 * fade in/out

Make it have a (USB?) rechargeable battery, with auto-off.
