A mini, puzzle orientated game hosted on a raspberry pi or similar
small device.

It could act as an open wifi access point, maybe running some sort of
captive portal?

Make it text based, with a green screen terminal interface - accessing
any website would redirect you to the opening page of the game - green
screen themed. Hinting at retro nature and hopefully pointing people
towards possibilities like Telnet/Gopher etc.

Possible Themes:
 - Murder mystery
 - Educational
 - Retro Futuristic
   - Early internet protocols (Gopher, etc) but evolved to modern usage
 - Time travel - sent form the future but misjudged current technology?
 - ???

It could have a twitter (or other social network) feed:
 - Progress updates (e.g. "gilesp has joined the game", "johnsmith has
   discovered a clue")
 - (Alternatively?) the home screen could display a status feed

Part of the game could be a gopher server running on the host
 - Clues to gopher presence:
   - A reference to the gopher RFC could act as an early clue
   - The host/port could be enciphered somehow
   - (partial) Code for gopher client on a page on captive portal
     - Also discussion of (modern) gopher clients
 - Gopher server could contain content for story section and/or clues
   to next section

Puzzles
 - Baudot - telegraph code?
