# Tool to automate web publishing

Using a static site generation tool, how can I easily publish to other channels such as Facebook or twitter?

The tool should have a configurable list of publishers, along with their characteristics (e.g. API key, min/max length, etc.)

When run, new posts would be automatically published to the configured channels along with a link back to the master web page produced by the static site generation tool.

## Options

* http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE POSSE indieweb federation strategy. Could I develop a hugo extension to do this?
