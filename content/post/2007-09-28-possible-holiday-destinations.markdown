Well I really fancy taking a holiday soon - I've not had a proper one in ages. I've been thinking about a city break in eastern europe maybe.

I've just found out that there is an airport at Coventry which is serviced by [Thompson Fly](http://www.thomsonfly.com/) and [WizzAir](http://wizzair.com/?language=EN). WizzAir fly to Gdansk and [Katowice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katowice) in Poland, and after reading up a bit, I quite fancy the idea of Katowice - maybe make a photography trip out of it. But mainly it's the thought of flying with a company called "WizzAir" that has me tickled.

I haven't had a proper holiday in years - there just hasn't been the time/money/inclination for me to go away and I'm not thrilled by the idea of going away totally on my own. The last time I went away was to a friend's wedding in Italy last June, but that was a big family get together and the whole wedding thing depresssed me massively so I didn't enjoy it perhaps as much as I would have liked.

I'm not a big fan of laying around on a beach, I prefer to be doing things. I've long had the desire to do something like a cycling tour of somewhere but can't make my mind up where that "somewhere" is. Maybe I should go for one of those charity fund raising trips and do a bit of good while I have a holiday at the same time? Although that's probably something to plan for next year...

This year I have plenty of holiday to use up so I'm taking a week off in October while my Mum comes to visit and then I may take a week in November just to mooch about a bit - maybe visit some friends? Anyone fancy I visit - I promise to bring cake and tea?
