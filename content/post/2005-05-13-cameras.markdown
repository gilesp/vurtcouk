I'll expand on this entry when I get more time, but here is a quick list of the cameras I own (y'know, i case you want to rob me or something):





  * Canon AV-1 SLR


  * Lubitel 166U


  * Agfa Isola 1


  * Lomo 135BC


  * Houghton-Butcher Ensign 2 1/4B Box Camera


  * Houghton-Butcher pocket carbine folding camera



Nothing fancy, mostly old, but I like 'em all.
