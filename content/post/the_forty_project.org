* I recently turned 40...
And my partner gave me a rather interesting gift:

Rather than buying me something (I have enough stuff), she has
thoughtfully given me a series of forty challenges and experiences to
do over the course of the following year.

Each card contains a clue to a gift or experience or a challenge for
me to complete: [[file:http://photos.vurt.co.uk/uploads/big/e52463efec7518d3fbc351bdb84f5de3.JPG][A selection of challenges]]

I'm going to blog about each activity as I do it, and some of the
challenges will spawn sub-projects, so I'm going to be pretty busy
over the next year. That's partly the point, as my teenage daughter is
moving to Dubai with her mum and step-family, so my partner thought
this would be something to keep my mind off things in the long gaps
between visits. Besides, we also have a 1 year old son, so it's going
to be interesting fitting everything in around him!

Here's the full list of activities (in no particular order):

+ Have a spooky experience
+ Visit a gin specialist
+ Follow a geocaching trail
+ £50 to spend at Superdry

Some may seem vague or trivial but they each have some significance to
me, and some(*) are just hints at an activity that has already been
planned out. There are plenty that will need some thought and planning
on my part, particularly the ones where I get to decide on something
(maybe have a surfing lesson, skydive??), so feel free to drop me a
line with any suggestions you may have ;-)
