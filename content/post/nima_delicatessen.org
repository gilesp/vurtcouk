Â£20 to spend at B13 8DD? Yes, it's another shopping "challenge". This
time though, I had no idea what the shop was.

One Thursday, after a morning session of [[http://www.musicshakers.com/][Music Shakers]] in King's
Heath, we took a stroll over to Moseley so that I could find out what
was at B13 8DD.

What I found when we arrived there was an amazing looking shop called
Nima Delicatessen. It's a proper old school grocery store that stocks
the most amazing products. Some are familiar while most were brands or
varieties of familiar brands that I'd never seen before. While it
calls itself a delicatessen, the fresh produce selection was limited,
but looked amazing, none the less.

I spent most of my time excitedly browsing the store picking things up
to marvel at them or calling to K to come and have a look. As a
result, I neglected to take any pictures of the inside, so if you want
to know what it's like, you'll just have to go and see for yourself.

I managed to buy several things with my gift but could have spent an
absolute fortune in there. I'll definitely be returning. I ended up
buying some orecchiette pasta, some marinaded artichokes, some Oolong
tea, some amazing ginger cake made with stem ginger and rye flour,
some Patum Peperium (The Gentleman's Relish) and a selection of fresh
canoli.

Unfortunately, I couldn't take a picture of the shop keeper's feet for
the [[/post/40feet][40 feet]] project, so I included K's feet in the shot instead:

Also, on the way back, we stopped off at [[http://damascena.co.uk/][Damascena]], an amazing coffee
house, for Turkish coffee and cakes. Yum!
