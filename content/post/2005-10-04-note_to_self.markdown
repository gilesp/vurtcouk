Streaming video from the computer to the netgem using VLC worked with mpeg2 video at 1024kbs with audio at 192kbs.

Quality was fairly poor, so try increasing video rate to 2048kbs.

Also resolution was slightly wrong in that the image seemed to be "zoomed". The edges of the picture were lost.
Try looking up correct PAL resultions  (VCD/SVCD and DVB-T)
