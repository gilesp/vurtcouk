Today I managed to burn my foot. How did I do this, I hear you ask. Well, I did it by walking. Walking barefoot. On a pavement. For about 20 metres.  

  

That is all it took for me to receive burns to both feet and a blister 5cmx6cm and about 1.5cm thick.  

  

Why was I walking barefoot? To reach the icecream van before it left so that I could buy an icecream for my daughter izzy.  

  

My god does it hurt.  

  

I am forced to hobble everywhere now and take large amounts of pain killers.
