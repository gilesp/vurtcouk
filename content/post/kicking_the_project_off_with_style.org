Last weekend I got the 40 Project off to a nice start by completing
the most straight-forward (and traditionally present-like) of the
cards: "Â£50 to spend at Superdry". 

Why Superdry? Well they happen to make shirts that fit my tall, skinny
frame plus they're decent quality. And most importantly of all, I like
them. Judge me; I don't care!

We popped into our local store while we were in town and I ended up
looking like this:

I also took the opportunity to start another card, namely the
[[/post/40feet][40 Feet]] photo project. One "Excuse me, this is a rather strange
request but can I take a quick photo of your feet?" later and I had
the first of 40 photographs for the sub-project:

I was extremely nervous about asking a total stranger if I could
photograph his feet, but he was totally cool about it. It was a great
start to the project.
