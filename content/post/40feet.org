One of the challenges set for me as part of my [[/tags/40project][40 Project]] was to take
pictures of 40 pairs of feet.

INSERT PICTURE OF CARD

Now I could have gone out and found freiends, family or colleagues to
take part in this project but it seemed like a fairly arbitrary reason
andI wasn't sure if the resulting collection would have a cohesive
theme. 

I instead decided that I would make it a documentary project,
recording the people who have helped me achieve the other challenges
and experiences I'll be completing. I'll aim to include something
relevant to the experience in the photograph along with the feet of
the people who've helped me along the way.

I'll be including some of the pictures on my
[[https://www.instagram.com/patersongiles][instagram account]] as I go, but the full images will be available on
this site, as part of the posts I make about the challenges, and on my
[[https://photos.vurt.co.uk/#15007543688204][photo site]]
