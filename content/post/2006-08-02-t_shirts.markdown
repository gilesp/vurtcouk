There's a new online t-shirt company started up called [Dshirt.co.uk](http://www.dshirt.co.uk/) They seem to be following a similar model to [threadless.com](http://www.threadless.com/) but being UK based, tshirts should arrive a bit sooner :-)





They also have a competition running at the moment: [Win Â£15,000 with Dshirt and Datawrite](http://www.dshirt.co.uk)
