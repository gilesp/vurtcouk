Well, as you may have noticed, vurt.co.uk has changed somewhat. I'm in the middle of revamping the site so things will be in a state of flux for a while.

All the old posts have disappeard, although I still have them archived. I may resurrect some of the more interesting ones as I go, but don't hold your breath.
I want to concentrate more on using this site to display some of my photographs.

Anyway, that's all for now, sorry for any inconvenience.
