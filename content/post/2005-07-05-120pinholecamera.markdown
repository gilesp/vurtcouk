Well, I'm camera obsessed. There's no denying it. I was bored last weekend,
so what did I do? I built myself a pinhole camera, that's what. And not just
any old pinhole camera, this one takes 120 roll film and produces 6cmx4.5cm
negatives.

So why 120 roll film? Well, I wanted to make a pinhole camera that could  take multiple shots, and I didn't fancy just creating something like the  [dirkon](http://www.pinhole.cz/en/pinholecameras/dirkon_01.html)  35mm pinhole camera.

I chose 645 format for the negatives because I wanted to make my pinhole  camera as compact as possible. I personally prefer 6x6 square negatives, but  that would have required a longer camera and possibly a slightly greater focal  length.

Eventually I'll get around to writing up the construction process in a bit  more detail, but for now I'll just say that the camera is made of 6mm thick,  black foam core board. And is held together with PVA glue and black electrical  tape. The shutter and red window cover are made of 3mm black card left over  from mounting some photographs. The pinhole is made from a piece of aluminium  cut from a can of Dr. Pepper and ground down with fine sand paper.

And now for some technical details (probably innacurate as I'm not 100%  sure of the size of the pinhole):
