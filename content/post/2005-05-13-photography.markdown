My interest in photography has been rekindled recently, and I am currently taking evening classes in black & white photography and darkroom work.

I intend to implement a nice little photo gallery on this site to show some of my photographs. However, I'm still playing around with some ideas at the moment so I don't have anything implemented yet.

In the mean time you can take a look at my old photo gallery at [http://photos.vurt.co.uk/](http://photos.vurt.co.uk/) which are mostly just family snapshots. Also, I have a flickr account so feel free to head on over to [http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpaterson/](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gpaterson/) to look at what I have uploaded there.
