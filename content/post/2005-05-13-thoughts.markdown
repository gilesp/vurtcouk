I originaly started my website (eons ago...) so that I would have somewhere to dump my random thoughts and what not.

Strangely it never really quite worked out like that. Although I do have a (private) wiki that is more or less serving as a brain dump at the moment.

Anyway, my plan (always planning, rarely implementing), is to write up any useful things and thought I have here. Of course, I'll probably never get round to actually doing that, but you never know.
