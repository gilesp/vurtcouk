Now I don't normally use this site as a blog (or indeed for anything in particular), but I've just stumbled across some fantastic music, and since my [usual place](http://www.4rthur.com/) for reporting this sort of thing is down at the moment, I thought I'd post it here.  
  

Anyway, the band/artist in question is the Brighton based [metronomy](http://www.metronomy.co.uk/). The music is a very pleasing low-fi electronica that I find particularly appealing. I'm not very good at describing music, so it's probably best if you just [listen for yourself](http://www.myspace.com/metronomy). If you like it as much as I do, then I suugest you go out and buy the album _Pip Paine (pay the Â£5000 you owe)_ from the record label [holiphonic](http://www.holiphonic.com/).  
  

In case you're interested, I stumbled across this artist via the fantastic music blog [music for robots](http://music.for-robots.com/).
