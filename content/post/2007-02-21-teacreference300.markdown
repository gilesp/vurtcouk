I desperately need a new HiFi - my only source of music playing are my computers which are not exactly top quality. I've been playing more and more CDs lately as opposed to my massive MP3 collection, so I'd like something to do them justice.




However, it'd also need to handle my MP3s with aplomb too :-)




I've always liked the Teac reference kit and now they do the 300 unit which combines CD, DAB, USB, MP3 and... DVD support. It's perfect for me - space is at a premium and I'm sick of using my PS2 as my main DVD player.
