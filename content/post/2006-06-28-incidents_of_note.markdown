I currently work for the [West Midlands Fire Service](http://www.wmfs.net/) as a Principal Systems Developer in their ICT department. As part of my job, I have access to data coming in from the firemen as they respond to incidents.




Most of this stuff is the usual fire and rescue stuff. Some of it's can be a bit grim reading as it is presented in a series of chronological snippets as the incident unfolds, so it can be a bit of a shock sometimes to find out someone has died, and all the grisly details.




However, every so often a more light-hearted incident occurs. I am, of course, talking about Cats Stuck In Trees! Now whilst there hasn't been an actual incident of a cat stuck in a tree since I've joined, the following similar events have occurred which I thought I'd share with you:




  * Bird trapped by leg in tree


  * Dog stuck in gate


  * Man with finger stuck in tap


  * Cat stuck on roof!



They brought a smile to my face when I read about them. This is what being a fireman is all about I imagine :-)
