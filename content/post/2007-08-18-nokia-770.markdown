I'm typing this post on my new Nokia 770, using a foldup bluetooth keyboard and the python based Maemo Wordpress client.  I have to say, it's a very nice portable computing platform.

Being linux based, it's more than just a PDA, it's more like having a proper computer to carry around with you all the time.  Without the keyboard, it's a little slow typing using the stylus and on screen keyboard, but it's acceptable. I've chatted with friends on Yahoo and MSN that way and didn't have any complaints :-) You wouldn't want to type for a long time that way though, which is where the bluetooth keyboard comes in. I'm using a Dell branded iGo Stowaway which is superb. It provides full size, laptop style keys in a package that folds up into something around the same size as the 770 itself.

All in all, I'm very happy with the device so far. I'll write up my thoughts on the software and give a fuller review soon.
