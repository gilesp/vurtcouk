I've always liked the Silent Hill games, but for one reason or another I missed out on Silent Hill 4 when it was released.




I must rectify that soon.






Well I have this game, but it's a pile of pants. A real disappointment. It's as if the people who developed this game had only heard about the previous silent hill games in passing.
