      <description>&lt;p&gt;Add solar panel system to shed to provide power down at the patio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would need a solar panel (50W?), charge controller, battery (deep cycle lead acid) and an 240V inverter to run mains powered devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could get a submersible pump (are 12V ones available?) to put in the water barrels to use to water the veg patches better. Could this be automated with Raspi/arduino, solenoids and soil moisture sensors to provide automatic watering? Could tie it in to weather forecasts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get EL-wire and fix to outline of shed and power from the battery to provide funky lighting at the patio during the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
